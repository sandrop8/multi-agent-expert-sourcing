# Brainstorming of Full Agent Module Architecture

> **Total Scope**: This brainstorming document investigates **25+ Agent Modules** powered by **120+ Individual Agents** across all user journeys
> **Purpose**: Central architectural document organizing independent, modular multi-agent systems by supply/demand sides and user journey stages. Each module operates as a self-sustaining multi-agent system that provides complete functionality without requiring other modules, allowing traditional recruiting platforms to selectively adopt specific modules based on their needs.
> **Important**: This document is work in progress and especially all agent definitions are subject to change as they have not yet been fully reviewed. Consider all module specifications and agent collections as draft concepts pending further refinement and validation.
> **Current Focus**: This document currently focuses on **Project Owners (Demand Side)** and **Freelancers (Supply Side)** user journeys. **Service Provider modules are not in current scope** and are marked as such throughout the document.

### Agent Module Template

> **Usage**: Copy and customize this template when creating new agent modules. Replace all placeholder content with module-specific details. If placeholder do not make sense for certain modules leve values N/A but keep the keys for the key value pairs, e.g. - [Quantified metric]: N/A

```
#### [Stage]: [Module Name]
**Purpose**: [Clear description of what this module automates/achieves]

**Module Input**: [Specific input parameters needed - like Python function parameters: e.g., cv_file_id: str, user_id: str, website_url: str]
**Module Output**: [Structured output format - preferably Pydantic models for database storage: e.g., CompanyProfileModel, CVProcessingResultModel, or file outputs like markdown/images when appropriate]

**AI Module Business Value Potential**: [Describe the AI-specific value using applicable metrics: quantified improvements over manual processes, time savings vs traditional methods, quality/accuracy gains, error reduction benefits, data richness improvements, or other relevant value indicators]
**AI Module Challenges**: [Identify key challenges to address: data quality assurance without human oversight, accuracy validation, edge case handling, or other risks that could impact module effectiveness]

**User Journey Context**: [When in user journey - specific situation/need being addressed]
**User Benefits**: [Single bullet point describing what users gain from this module: time saved, better outcomes, more options, improved preparation, enhanced insights, or other qualitative/quantitative user value]

**Workflow Pattern**: [Hierarchical/Sequential/Collaborative/Graph-based/ReAct/Tree of Thoughts]
**Orchestrator**: [Central coordinator agent name or "None" for task-driven sequences]

**Agent Collection**:
- **[Agent Name]**
  - **Role**: [Specific responsibility and domain expertise]
  - **Tools**: [Specific tools, APIs, or "None" for AI only analysis]
  - **Instructions**: [Specific behavior and output requirements]
  - **Workflow Logic**: [For Sequential: "Executes after [Agent Name]" | For Hierarchical: "Reports to [Orchestrator], receives handoffs for [specific scenarios]" | For Collaborative: "Collaborates with [Agent Names] on [shared task]" | For Graph-based: "Triggered by [condition/agent], outputs to [next agents]" | For ReAct: "Iterates with [tools/environment]" | For Tree of Thoughts: "Explores [reasoning path], converges with [other agents]"]

- **[Agent Name]**
  - **Role**: [Specific responsibility and domain expertise]
  - **Tools**: [Specific tools, APIs, or "None" for AI-powered analysis]
  - **Instructions**: [Specific behavior and output requirements]
  - **Workflow Logic**: [For Sequential: "Executes after [Agent Name]" | For Hierarchical: "Reports to [Orchestrator], receives handoffs for [specific scenarios]" | For Collaborative: "Collaborates with [Agent Names] on [shared task]" | For Graph-based: "Triggered by [condition/agent], outputs to [next agents]" | For ReAct: "Iterates with [tools/environment]" | For Tree of Thoughts: "Explores [reasoning path], converges with [other agents]"]

[Additional agents as needed...]

**Current Status**: Initially implemented as CrewAI Framework demonstration - showcases sequential workflow with web scraping capabilities for company profiling
```

**Template Guidelines**:
- **Module Input**: Specify exact input parameters like Python function parameters - be concrete about data types and sources
- **Module Output**: Prefer Pydantic models for structured data that can be saved to Postgres/PGVector databases; use file outputs (markdown, images) only when content is inherently non-structured
- **AI Module Business Value Potential**: Use applicable metrics (quantified improvements, time savings, quality gains, etc.) - not all modules need all metric types
- **AI Module Challenges**: Identify risks/challenges to guide agent design and prompt engineering
- **User Journey Context**: Be specific about the exact moment/situation in the user's experience
- **User Benefits**: Focus on user outcomes - can be qualitative or quantitative as appropriate
- **Workflow Pattern**: Choose the most appropriate pattern for the task complexity and agent interaction needs
- **Agent Roles**: Keep focused and specialized - avoid agents that do "everything"
- **Tools**: Be specific about actual tools/APIs, use "None (AI-powered analysis)" for pure LLM tasks
- **Instructions**: Provide clear, actionable direction for agent behavior
- **Workflow Logic**: Define agent relationships using pattern-specific terminology (inspired by OpenAI Agents SDK handoffs and CrewAI task dependencies) - this enables easier implementation by clearly specifying execution order, handoff conditions, and collaboration patterns

## Cross-Journey Platform Modules

### NATS-Enabled Cross-Journey Module Architecture

**Cross-Journey Modules differ from regular agent modules in fundamental ways:**

**Key Differences:**
- **Communication Method**: Use NATS message bus for real-time cross-module communication instead of direct API calls
- **Event-Driven**: Triggered by NATS events from other modules rather than direct user requests
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle multiple concurrent workflows across different user journeys
- **Stateful Coordination**: Maintain conversation and workflow state across extended timeframes
- **Platform-Wide Scope**: Serve all user types (project owners, freelancers, service providers) simultaneously

**NATS Integration Patterns:**

#### Message Subject Architecture
```python
# NATS Subject Hierarchy for Cross-Journey Communication
CROSS_JOURNEY_SUBJECTS = {
    # Project lifecycle events
    'project.created': 'project.{project_id}.created',
    'project.updated': 'project.{project_id}.updated',

    # Matching events (bidirectional)
    'matching.freelancer.identified': 'matching.project.{project_id}.freelancer.{freelancer_id}.identified',
    'matching.scores.updated': 'matching.project.{project_id}.scores.updated',

    # Communication orchestration
    'communication.route': 'communication.{message_type}.route',
    'communication.clarification.request': 'freelancer.{freelancer_id}.clarification.{project_id}.request',
    'communication.clarification.response': 'project.{project_id}.clarification.{freelancer_id}.response',

    # Analytics and performance
    'analytics.user.journey': 'analytics.user.{user_id}.journey.{stage}',
    'analytics.platform.metric': 'analytics.platform.{metric_type}.{timestamp}',

    # Cross-module coordination
    'workflow.trigger': 'workflow.{module_name}.{action}.trigger',
    'workflow.complete': 'workflow.{module_name}.{action}.complete'
}
```
