"""
CV Extraction Service Tests - Redirect Notice

❗ ALL TESTS MOVED TO INTEGRATION DIRECTORY

The tests that were previously in this file have been moved to maintain
clear separation between fast unit tests and slower integration tests:

📁 Moved to:
- tests/integration/test_openai_integration.py (real API calls)
- tests/integration/test_service_availability.py (import/service tests)

🎯 This separation allows us to:
- Run fast unit tests locally (100% pass rate)
- Run integration tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Maintain clear test categorization
