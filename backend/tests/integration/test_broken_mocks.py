"""
Broken Mock Tests - TODO: Fix These

These tests have mocking issues that need to be resolved before they can be
included in the main test suite. They are separated here for future fixing.

🔧 TODO Tasks:
- Fix mocking setup for extraction tools functionality test
- Ensure proper mock alignment with actual service interfaces
- Update mock configurations to match current service implementations

⚠️ These tests are currently disabled and need attention
