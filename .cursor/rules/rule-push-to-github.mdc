# Push to Github with optionally linking an Issue Number

1. Explicit Trigger: Only ever push or commit to Github if the user explicitly ask to "push to GitHub", "commit and push", or mention linking/closing a specific issue. NEVER push code automatically.

If the user asks to push to github, ALWAYS follow exactly these steps:

**Scenario A (No Issue Mentioned)**: If the user just says "push to GitHub" (or similar) without mentioning an issue, I will not ask for an issue number. I will proceed directly to:
1. Ensure we're in the root directory (where .envrc is located for proper environment setup)
2. Run git status (to show you the changes).
3. Run quality checks with fallback approach:
   - **Primary**: Try `uv run --project backend pre-commit run --all-files` (from root directory)
   - **Fallback**: If pre-commit fails due to environment issues, run `./test-all.sh` (comprehensive test suite that works with direnv)
4. Run git add . (I need to always add all files instead of specific ones)
5. Create a descriptive commit message summarizing the changes (without any closes #... part).
6. If the user provides a commit message - use it.
7. Run git commit -m "Descriptive summary of changes".
8. Run git push.
9. Confirm success.

**Scenario B (Issue Mentioned/Requested)**: If the user explicitly asks to close or link a specific issue, or provides an issue number with your push request:
1. Ensure we're in the root directory (where .envrc is located for proper environment setup)
2. Run git status.
3. Run quality checks with fallback approach:
   - **Primary**: Try `uv run --project backend pre-commit run --all-files` (from root directory)
   - **Fallback**: If pre-commit fails due to environment issues, run `./test-all.sh` (comprehensive test suite that works with direnv)
4. Run git add .
5. Create a descriptive commit message summarizing the changes and ending with "closes #issuenumber" (or closes #123, closes #456 if multiple issues are mentioned).
6. If the user provides a commit message - use it and add the closes part at the end.
7. Run git commit -m "Descriptive summary closes #issuenumber".
8. Run git push.
9. Confirm success.

**Important Environment Setup**:
- Always run commands from the root directory where .envrc is located
- This ensures proper direnv environment activation and virtual environment setup
- Use `uv run --project backend` instead of `cd backend && uv run` to maintain root directory context

**Quality Assurance Strategy**:
- **First priority**: Run pre-commit hooks for fast, targeted quality checks
- **Fallback**: If environment issues prevent pre-commit from working, use `./test-all.sh` which:
  - Works reliably with direnv/.envrc setup
  - Runs comprehensive test suite (197/205 tests, 96% success rate)
  - Validates code quality across all frameworks
  - Provides confidence for production deployment
- **Never use `--no-verify`**: Always validate code quality before pushing

**Core Commands Preserved**: The sequence git status, quality checks, git add ., git commit ..., git push will be maintained in both scenarios.

```bash
# Ensure we're in root directory (where .envrc sets up environment)
git status
# Try pre-commit first, fallback to comprehensive test suite if needed
uv run --project backend pre-commit run --all-files || ./test-all.sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive message closes #issuenumber"
git push
```

**Final Notes**:
- Always assume we're working on the correct branch already, so branch switching is not required.
- NEVER just push a specific file to github. ALWAYS use 'git add .'
- Pre-commit hooks will run automatically during `git commit`, but we run them explicitly first for transparency and early error detection
- If pre-commit checks fail, fix the issues before proceeding with the commit
