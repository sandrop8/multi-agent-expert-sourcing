# Multi-Agent Expert Sourcing - Project Agenda

## Overview
This document outlines the two major next steps for developing our multi-agent expert sourcing application, focusing on backend agent implementation and frontend protocol integration.

---

## üéØ **Step 1: Multi-Agent Backend Implementation with OpenAI Agents SDK**

### **Objective**
Replace the single agent with a complete multi-agent system using the OpenAI Agents SDK example code. The SDK handles all complexity internally - we just need to integrate the provided code into our FastAPI backend.

### **Current Status**
- ‚úÖ Basic single-agent chat functionality working
- ‚úÖ FastAPI backend with CORS configuration
- ‚úÖ Database integration for conversation storage
- ‚úÖ Next.js frontend with real-time chat interface

### **Implementation: Direct Code Integration**

**What the SDK provides out-of-the-box:**
- ‚úÖ Agent handoffs and routing
- ‚úÖ Guardrail system with tripwire logic
- ‚úÖ Structured output handling
- ‚úÖ Automatic conversation management
- ‚úÖ Built-in tracing and logging

**Target Architecture:**
```
User Input ‚Üí Triage Agent ‚Üí [Math Tutor | History Tutor] ‚Üí Response
                ‚Üì
         Guardrail Check (Homework Filter)
```

### **Complete Implementation Code**

**File: `backend/main.py` - Agent System Section:**

```python
from agents import Agent, InputGuardrail, GuardrailFunctionOutput, Runner
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio

class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str

guardrail_agent = Agent(
    name="Guardrail check",
    instructions="Check if the user is asking about homework.",
    output_type=HomeworkOutput,
)

math_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="Math Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for math questions",
    instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning at each step and include examples",
)

history_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="History Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for historical questions",
    instructions="You provide assistance with historical queries. Explain important events and context clearly.",
)

async def homework_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    final_output = result.final_output_as(HomeworkOutput)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=not final_output.is_homework,
    )

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="You determine which agent to use based on the user's homework question",
    handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent],
    input_guardrails=[
        InputGuardrail(guardrail_function=homework_guardrail),
    ],
)
```

### **Backend Changes Required**

**File: `backend/main.py`**

**Simple Changes:**
1. **Replace** single `assistant = Agent(...)` with the multi-agent system above
2. **Update** chat endpoint to use `triage_agent` instead of `assistant`
3. **Add** proper imports for `InputGuardrail` and `GuardrailFunctionOutput`
4. **Handle** guardrail exceptions in the chat endpoint

**Updated Chat Endpoint:**
```python
@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(req: ChatReq):
    """Run the multi-agent system, store conversation, return response."""
    try:
        print(f"üîç Processing request: {req.prompt}")
        
        # Use triage_agent as entry point to multi-agent system
        result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, req.prompt)
        
        answer = result.final_output if result.final_output else "No response"
        print(f"‚úÖ AI Response: {answer}")

        # Store in database (existing logic)
        with engine.begin() as conn:
            conn.execute(messages.insert(), [
                {"role": "user",      "content": req.prompt},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": answer},
            ])
        
        return {"answer": answer}
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error in chat endpoint: {str(e)}")
        # Handle guardrail rejections gracefully
        if "guardrail" in str(e).lower():
            return {"answer": "Sorry, I can only help with homework-related questions."}
        raise HTTPException(500, str(e))
```

### **Testing Strategy**

**Test Cases:**
1. **Math Questions**: "What is 2+2?", "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15"
2. **History Questions**: "Who was the first president?", "When did WWII end?"
3. **Non-Homework Questions**: "What is life?", "Tell me a joke"

**Expected Behaviors:**
- Math questions ‚Üí Routed to Math Tutor Agent
- History questions ‚Üí Routed to History Tutor Agent  
- Non-homework ‚Üí Blocked by guardrail with friendly message
- All handoffs and routing handled automatically by SDK

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Multi-agent system replaces single agent
- [ ] Math questions get routed to Math Tutor
- [ ] History questions get routed to History Tutor
- [ ] Non-homework questions are blocked by guardrail
- [ ] Frontend continues to work without changes
- [ ] OpenAI tracing shows agent handoffs and guardrail decisions

**Note:** No database schema changes needed initially - the existing `messages` table will continue to work. The SDK handles all agent coordination internally.
